    Hello, my name is Rakib. I recently graduated with my Master's in Artificial Intelligence & Big Data. I am a Junior Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer seeking experience before I move to applied ML quantum.

    I have two years of experience as a Project Manager & Data Analyst at the same time during my apprenticeship.

## My history: How I came here

### High-school and first year bachelor's utopia

When I was 14'th, I had my first experience with computer science by being a Webmaster for my gaming team. I did not know much about programming. So I had to start with a content managing system named Nuked-Klan, and I was messing up with the modules.

Moving up the high school, I have decided that I will take the computer science field, and this is where I want to work. Naturally, I wanted to be a Web Developer, but things did not go well.

Thank's to the French random university assignment, I have ended up in a university with bachelor's lectures. It was not my original choice, and I had to deal with it.

In my first year bachelor, I had lectures where I needed to interview someone who already works as a Web Developer. I learned about the redundancy of a Web Developer. It deterred me from continuing down this path.

### Third year : My love with Data

During the third year of my bachelor's, I encountered SQL lectures. I was overwhelmed by data. I had fun during the exercises. I had to replicate the Allocin√© database as a project.

And finally, I had to search for a subject for my data visualization project. And that's where the South Korean government made the coronavirus data available, which makes it a perfect subject for this project.

### Mastere : Confirming my love for Data

#### At School 

I noticed that company wants people with experience. I can no longer stay in a classical course and need to increase my finances. It is only natural to pursue my studies through an apprenticeship.

I joined ESGI master's in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. It covers multiple data positions such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineer, to name a few.

I have no regrets, joining this school! I have never learned as much during these two years of master's degree as I did during my entire time in higher education, while keeping up with the rapid evolution of AI and Big Data. I am trained on the needs of today's and tomorrow's companies. 

This is where I differ from students who would have followed a classic university course.

#### Apprenticeship : La Poste Groupe

I was already a postman for La Poste Groupe before I began to look for an apprentice job in Data. I guess it helped me land this position.

They trained me as a Project Manager, something entirely different from my master's. I was reserved at the beginning but I got used to it. I can't thank my tutor and his superiors enough for keeping my job related to Data.

I am surrounded by directors and decision-makers which puts pressure on me, and I have been able to control over time. I have also improved my communication to give concise and understandable information. It was not easy given the senior management status.

One of the major events I had was representing a branch in a tender for data visualization. I had to write, evaluate a proof of concept and present the work to an executive committee.

I did not receive a valuable offer to stay for La Poste, and it saddens me to leave them.

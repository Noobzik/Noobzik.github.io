# Data Marketing analysis

## Context

We have a habit of regularly eating in fast food restaurants. We are interested in what we eat and have recently decided to adopt a healthier diet. A simple alternative is to simply avoid the two biggest burger chains in France and to go and eat sandwiches in a restaurant offering very good quality food. That's why we chose the Steak'n Shake company and will compare it with McDonald's and Burger King.

This company was established in France relatively recently, in 2014, and now has about thirty stores in France.  

The goal of this project is to determine a problem that applies to this brand and to apply a data marketing method to answer it.

**In short, How to make customers come more often?**

We offered three solutions based on our analysis:

*  Loyalty system
*  Limited time offer
*  Time and localisation sensitive notification

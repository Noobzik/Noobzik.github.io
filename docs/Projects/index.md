# Project Overview

!!! warning
    This section have missing contents.

Since 2015, I have done numerous projects throughout my academic year, some of them personal. Projects are here to demonstrate my skills in various fields of computer science.

On the left side, you can find all my projects in detail.

!!! note
    Most of my projects are available at Github : [https://github.com/Noobzik](https://github.com/Noobzik)

??? abstract "This website (active: 2022)"

    In France, for a resume, we can not tell everything under one page. So I have to keep it short and relevant to the offer I am applying for. This is where my website comes in to fill the details gap.

    This core website is made with "Material for MkDocs" by squidfunk, which allows me to quickstart writing documentation using Markdown language. I was inspired by the implementation of FlyByWire A320x documentation and I thought I should do that, and I can make several parts.

    Those parts are :

    -  Projects listings (you are reading it now yay!).
    -  Getting to know me.
    -  My professionnal experience.
    -  My teaching materials for my students.
    -  And last but not least: A blogging part for my findings.

    I have used Docker to quickstart my development and live testing before deploying it into an AWS instance.

??? abstract "My first year website : A database of exams (inactive 2015 - 2020)"

    During my studies in bachelor's courses, I had the bad habit to lost every exam subject, and my co-students are not teamwork-focused when I ask them if they can share with me. In France, you can retake the year in case of semester failure. And if you have good contacts, you can ask upper-year students to share their exam subjects to prepare yourself when the time comes. This is where my first website comes in.

    It was partially written from scratch because I used Bootstrap and SweetAlert framework. The languages I have used are HTML, CSS, and PHP

    My database helped over 300 bachelor's students throughout my stay. It is sad to say that the content of my website was ripped-off by the "Bureau des Etudiant de Licence Institut Galilée" to make a profit from poor students after I left this university.

??? abstract "A community anti-cheat and server management : Tools4Games (2011 - 2013)"

    In the free-to-play game where I was playing, the community noticed the cheat rate was actually rising. Sadly there were no actions taken by the game editor.

    An acquaintance from Switzerland, Netherlands, and India decided to build an application that can kick and ban cheating players from the servers. I have joined in their journey to brainstorm about the limitations of what a human can possibly do.

    Moreover, I helped the team build open-source server management with basic features and added exclusive features such as chat history, chat commands, map rotation, item bans, and ban list just to name a few. And I have done the French translation with the help of my teammate.

    I have worked in pure PHP on the anti-cheat part and in both python and PHP for server management.

??? abstract "A gaming team website with a content management system (inactive 2011 - 2013)"

    I discovered computer sciences by gaming into an FPS game. The team I was in needed a website to promote itself, have an internal forum, blogging features, and a calendar to plan team matches. Then I discovered Nuked-Klan, a CMS ready to use after a considerable effort of customazing the website.

    This is where I began to be a Webmaster of the team website. The languages I have used are PHP, HTML, and CSS. I also had to brush up my Photoshop skill's to make the background image.

## Summary of University Bachelor's

The subject of my bachelor's was Computer Science. I attended this course at Paris, Université Paris 13. The departement was Institut Galilée. This is not an extensive list of all lectures I had to attend. Only the significance of an academic project will be listed here.

### First year

During my first year, I learned the basic of computer science such as :


??? abstract "C langugage (Imperative programming)"

    This was my first programming language. I had to deal with compilation error, warnings fixes and memory management. Moreover, I was introduced with linked list, stack and file management data structure.

    Two projects were made in order to demonstrate the ability to code in C:

    * Chess 
    * Shogi

??? abstract "C Languge Graphical Interface"

    Small project to implement a find the ball among the displayed chess with GTK Library

### Second year

My second year consolidate the basics of computer science by manipulating data structures and programming assembly code, network and systems :

??? abstract "Data Structure & Algorithms"

    I have seen how to implement stack, queue, linked lists, binary search tree, hash map and heap.

A city search project was made in order to demonstrate binary search tree and heap.

??? abstract "Designing Algorithm"

    Dynamic programming, Master Theoreme, Big O and Theta notation.

??? abstract "Oriented Object Programming (Java)"

    I was introduced the object oriented programing paradigme.
    The project was Zork. You can find more info here : (not yet available for documentation)

??? abstract "Functional Programming with OCaml"
    I was introduced a new paradigme of programming which is functional with OCaml. A project was made to encode flags.

??? abstract "Systems and network"
    On the systems, it was the OS level programming part with Forks, Semaphores, Threads and sigint signal management.
    On the network part, it was the IPV4, MTU, Ip class and subnets. No project was made.

### Third year

And finally at my last year, it was focused on Data Science basics:

??? abstract "Automata and Language Theory"

??? abstract "Data visualization with Python & KNIME"
    CoronaVirus SarS-CoV-2 from the Gouvernement of South Korea

??? abstract "Database with Oracle SQL"
    Build a database similar to Allociné. The features is the name of movies, series, seasons, cast, forums and registered members

??? abstract "Graph Algorithms"
    Build a smalll program that generate 

??? abstract "Functionnal Programming with OCaml 2"

??? abstract "Open Sourced Software (ITIL, GLPI, Astérix)"
    Replicate an Internet provider router with open sourced software

??? abstract "Web Programming (HTML, CSS, PHP, javascript)"
    Make a 'Find the flag' game website written in HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript with a database (mariadb)

??? abstract "Computer system modeling"
    

## Summary of University Master's

After I was graduated from the bachelor, I wanted to gain experience and study at the same time. The reason for this was company are now looking for experienced peoples instead of the level of graduation.

Therefore, I joined ESGI (Ecole Supérieur du Génie Informatique), a two year program as an apprentice (3 week at work, 1 week at school).

Things to note : The "Intelligence Artificielle & Big Data" course is made in 3 years (1 year as bachelor, and 2 year as master). Therefore, I was admitted at the 2nd year of the cours (so the 1st year of masters). I had to work even harder to catchup all lecture that are necessary to follow untill the gradutation.

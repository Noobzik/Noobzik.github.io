!!! note "Abstract"

    A financial market is a place where a financial transaction takes place. Whether we are talking about Wall Street or the neighborhood market, we can take advantage of the rules and instruments used to make a profit. Our goal for this thesis is to develop a bot in Python capable of using the usual strategies in finance to obtain a risk-free profit.

    -   At first, we will see the different financial products on which we rely. 
    -   Secondly, we will look in detail at the strategies currently used to invest with low risk. 
    -   Next, we will see how to code the bot so that it starts to make financial transactions. 
    -   Finally, we will make it learn the usage of the most optimal strategies using **extreme machine learning**.

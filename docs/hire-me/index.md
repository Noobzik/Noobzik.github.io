* [You can access to my resume here](../resume_cv-Generic.pdf)


!!! note
    *Thank you for considering hiring me! Here you can find all pieces of information which I think are relevant.*

*  My apprenticeship contract for La Poste Groupe has ended. My position was Project Manager and Data Analyst.
*  I graduated with a Master of Artificial Intelligence & Big Data (from [ESGI Paris](https://esgi.fr)).
*  Even though I am now a Freelancer teacher, **I am still looking for a full-time permanent contract to start right after my mission ends** (*right now is February 8th*)


## What positions I can accept?

Thanks to my Master full stack data-driven course, I can hold the following positions (Ordered by top preferences to least):

1.  Machine Learning Engineer
2.  Data Scientist

If you are recruiting on profile, I can fulfill almost one of your position.

## What am I looking for?

*  I am looking for a company that is **Data-driven** or aiming to be. I want to help them create value for their data. It helps me fine-tune my approach to dealing with data and the business team's problems more effectively. Bonus point for Datalab, participating in data communities and open-sourced projects.
*  I am looking for support to increase my technical data skills. I am teaching for 5 different schools and they have trusted me for 2 year, ever since I graduated.
*  I can work on-site anywhere in France as long as you can help me with housing if it's not in Ile-de-France and with transportation.
*  I'm also open to working in the following country: Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Germany.


## Why should you hire me?

*  I am willing to learn and always keep up with technological intelligence by attendings events like "Big Data & IA Paris", and Google Summit and mostly reading papers on ArXiv. I also participate in Kaggle code competitions to put into practice my findings.
*  Thanks to my two-year's apprenticeship as a Project Manager and being part of a business team, I know how to manage projects and call a tender. Moreover, I can remain impartial when it comes to decisions. I have helped the executive committee to make the right choice regardless of their biased opinions. I am open to debate in the interest of the company.
*  Being part of a business team helped me understand business data problems and how to answer them accordingly.
*  Schools have trusted me for 2 years about lecturing their students, ever since I graduated.
*  I am result oriented, which means that my work contributes to the company's annual objective. Just like I had during my apprenticeship.
